This is the repository of the [emotion detection](https://studentmorrisjohn.com/projects/emotion_detection/) project I made.

It contains the jupyter notebook i used for the training of the model and the python file i used for the flask app. An article about this project is written in my [website](https://studentmorrisjohn.com/)
